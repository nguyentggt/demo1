    <h1>Introduction to Push-ups</h1>
<p>The push-up is a classic compound exercise that works multiple muscles in just two movements,
down and up. It can also target the chest, triceps and shoulders. However, over the years there are
even more variations that can aid other muscle groups as well. Check out the list below.</p>

     <h3><b><span style="color: #ff1d1d;">Standard Military Pushup</span></b> </h3>
     <div>
     <img src="../homework/standardmilitarypushup.jpg" alt="Military Pushup"><br />
    </div>
 <p>Go <i>all the way down</i> and all the way up, locking scapula. As "easy" as it is. </p>
      
     <h3><b><span style="color: #88ff00;">Decline Pushup</span></b></h3>
     <div>

    </div>
      <p>
       This variation works the upper chest and is much more difficult. This is because you now
       no longer have your legs to support your weight.

      <h3><b><span style="color: #372af8;">Cobra Pushup</span></b></h3>
      <div>

    </div>
      <p>
    This unique variation originates from India. It works mostly the triceps this time, rather
than the chest, as usual. The pause also makes it harder than the regular variant, because of
longer exposure to tension as your triceps dictate the movement.</p>
      
     <h3><b>Archer Pushup</b></h3>
     <div>
     <img src="../homework/archerpushup.jpg"><br />
    </div>
      <p>
        As we progress into a more challenging variation, archer pushup really takes it to 
    another level. It's almost similar to feeling only 1 arm doing the work the whole time! </p>

    <h3><b>One-arm Pushup</b></h3>
    <div>
     <img src="../homework/onearmpushup.jpg"><br />
    </div>
      <p>And here we are, one of the most difficult pushup variations to boot! For more
          advanced levels, you can make the exercise even harder. Beware of muscle 
        imbalance, though, because you only make one arm put in the work!</p>
