     <h3><b>Tip 1: The Setup</b> </h3>
        <p>
            <li>Hold the camera <b>as far away</b> from your body as possible.</li>
            <li>Try using a selfie stick, tripod, or even asking a stranger to take the photo. </li> 
            <li>Having the phone farther away will help prevent distortion and generally yields better photos</li>.</p> 
      
     <h3><b>Tip 2: Lighting</b></h3>
      <p>
        <li><mark>Make sure the light is not too harsh or too dim.</mark></li> 
        <li>Taking photos between <i>10am and 3pm</i> usually means the light will be too harsh
      unless you find a protected area where the sunlight doesn’t fall directly on you.</li>
    </p>
      
      <h3><b>Tip 3: Angle</b></h3>
      <p>
          <li>If you take photos after dusk you might need some external light
      sources to keep your face well-lit and the image clear. </li>
      <li>Take the photo from a higher angle. Higher angles are preferred by many and when done
      well, look more natural.</li></p>
      
     <h3><b>Tip 4: Posture</b></h3>
      <p>
          <li>Just don’t hold the camera too high. Keep your poses natural and unforced.</li> 
    <li>Most communication that occurs between people
      is nonverbal, and for that reason we’ve become adept at figuring out
      what’s natural and what’s staged.</li></p>

    <h3><b>Tip 5: Others</b></h3>
      <p>Try to keep your poses as relaxed and
      natural as possible, as it’s noticeable when a pose is stiff and forced.</p>
    </p><mark>Look for symmetry.</mark> The human brain has been proven to favor patterns and symmetry. 
    Playing into that tendency often yields more visually appealing photos. 
    For example, placing the subject of the image next to a reflective surface often produces 
    interesting and relaxed photos.
